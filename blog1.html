            Hello everyone, myself Rajender Kapil a BCA student from IGNOU University. I basically belong from
            Uttrakhand but spent my entire life in Delhi.<br><br>

            In 1st year of my college days i got to know about web development from my friend's older brother. He is
            working as a front-end developer in a reputed company. He told me all about the web development and how can
            i start. He helped to build my first PC and give a roadmap to me.<br><br>

            So, I started practising through tutorials and different courses. I followed the tutorials but found no
            progress and then followed another course and tutorial. After some time i realise that I'm not progressing
            in this. Also, i can't give it too much time because at the same time I'm also doing a part-time job to
            fullfill my financial needs. So, after few months i left doing coding because I'm not seeing any hopes in
            that for me. After all this, 1 year is done and I'm nothing done good in this field. I was demotivated,
            depressed but after some time when I'm scrolling in Instagram i saw tanay pratap advertisement and go to his
            profile where he is helping youngsters in web development field. I started watching his stories from there i
            got to know about neog Camp. I researched on it and start level zero. I was motivated again, but this time
            something is different i was enjoying watching tutorials, watching tanay bhaiya, one thing that i admire
            most about tanay bhaiya is the way he teaches it was extraordinary. After watching his tutorial i started to
            practice it.<br><br>

            After completing mark 15 it was time for the blog and let me tell you guys it was so difficult for me i
            can't even tell you guys but I'll tell you about it in my next blog. Somehow i managed it. I have submitted
            the assignment and waiting to review it. I will tell you guys about my experience in Neog camp after the
            selection in some other blogs.<br><br>
